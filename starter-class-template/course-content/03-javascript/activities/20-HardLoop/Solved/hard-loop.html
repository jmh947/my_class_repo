      var myFarm = ["chickens", "pigs", "cows", "horses", "ostriches"];
      //Step 1.
      //What: Create an array of farm animals
      //Why: To have a listing of all my farm animals
      //How: Use the assignment operator and the bracket notations for array creation

      //Step 2. 
      //What: Iterate through the array and examine every element
      //Why: To examine each string
      //How: with a for loop

      //Step 3.
      //what: While examining each element check to see if the string starts with a C or an O. 
      //Why: Because if it does...party time! 
      //How: Access the first position of the string with hard bracket notation

      // Step 4.
      // what: if it does conatin C or O as the first character alter the user
      //why: Cause that is what is being asked - weirdo. 
      //how: the use of the alert() function


      // This is our starting myFarm array.
      var myFarm = ["chickens", "pigs", "cows", "horses", "ostriches"];

      // Creating a variable to hold our array length.
      // var arrayLength = myFarm.length;

      // Looping through our myFarm array.
      for (var j = 0; j < myFarm.length; j++) {

        // Console out the farm animal in the current index.
    

        // If the first character in the current animal is "c" or "o", alert the following message.
        // if (myFarm[j].charAt(0) === "c" || myFarm[j].charAt(0) === "o") {
        //   alert(myFarm[j] + " Starts with a c or an o!");
        // }

        var animal = myFarm[j];
        animal[0];
        console.log(animal);

        // if (myFarm[j][0] === "c" || myFarm[j][0] === "o") {
        //   alert(myFarm[j] + " Starts with a c or an o!");
        // }
