#### Tutoring
[Back to top](#student-support)

Tutoring Sessions will be made available to you if needed.

These sessions require that you have turned in homework and are in good standing with your attendance.

**How the system works:**

1) If you are interested in tutoring, you can find a chat window within BootcampSpot to request a tutor. You must also meet the attendance and homework requirements 

2) Once you have communicated your desire for a tutor through BootcampSpot the Student will receive an email with their assigned tutor 24-48 hours.Student will need to schedule their first session 24-48 hours after receiving email. 

Steps: 

**Step ONE** Log into BCS, on the main page click the support button on the nav bar.

 <div style="text-align:center"><img src="assets/images/tutoring/tutor-step-01.jpg" alt="icon" width="400"></div>

**Step TWO** From the drop down choose “I am a student” and “Tutor Request”. In the text box include topics you’d like support with along with your Github username. 

  <div style="text-align:center"><img src="assets/images/tutoring/tutor-step-02.jpg" alt="icon" width="400"></div>

**Step THREE** You will receive an email from Central Supports within 24-48 hours connecting you to your assigned tutor!




#### Tutoring Details
[Back to top](#student-support)

**Keep in mind any time zone differences. Please make sure to discuss it with your tutor.  This issue has created a few missed sessions in the past.**

**Sessions should be 45 minutes in length. Once a week via a video using google hangouts.**

4) At the end of each session discuss scheduling the next session.  

5) Both the tutor and the student are **required** to fill out an evaluation form after EACH session.  Data is very important to the ongoing success of Central Support.  **Every tutor assignment email has the link to the Student’s Evaluation Form.**

* **If a student No-Shows to a session, the student may not be eligible for tutoring in the future.**

* **If student needs to change the appointment communicate with your tutor immediately.**
